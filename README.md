# MYC-Amplification-in-Congenital-Heart-Disease-and-Cancer-in-Kids-First-and-INCLUDE-Data-Set

Using the Elements of Style in Workflow creation approach as taught in the https://nih-nichd.github.io, the team will work together to containerize the processing steps and stitch them together in a workflow language.   On Cavatica, the workflow language best supported is Common Workflow Language (CWL).

## Background

MYC is an oncoprotein and often implies worse outcomes, however it also seems to have a role in cardiovascular disease. Using open data from both the INCLUDE Data Hub and the Kids First Data Resource Portal, this Hackathon will:

* Explore MYC expression and its segregating effects at the intersection of congenital heart defects and cancer

* Build platform agnostic workflows and analysis notebooks using the elements of style method (https://nih-nichd.github.io) that will use both WGCNA and limma to probe the dual role of this gene.

* Result both in a tutorial of how to proceed from both https://portal.includedcc.org/ and https://portal.kidsfirstdrc.org to https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/ as well as produce results in notebooks that could be used as figures in a paper promoting open transparent, reproducible results.
